### Project Overview

You are tasked with developing a **stunning demo website for Foundations AI**, a company specializing in cutting-edge voice AI agents. The website must serve as an interactive showcase, highlighting the advanced capabilities of these AI agents through a visually impressive and user-friendly interface. The primary objective is to engage visitors immediately without requiring authentication, delivering a seamless and captivating experience that leaves a lasting impression on potential clients. The Foundations AI **mountain PNG logo** must be a central and prominent feature, symbolizing the brand’s identity throughout the design.

This project requires integrating **specific functionalities** (voice interaction, agent selection, payment processing, SMS notifications, and calendar management) with **award-worthy design elements** (smooth scrolling, geometric layouts, parallax effects, and animated components). The website should be responsive across all devices—desktops, tablets, and smartphones—ensuring a consistent and polished experience. Your work in Replit will leverage HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integrations to bring this vision to life.

### Core Features

The website must include the following features, each implemented with precision and aligned with the specified tools and design goals:

1. **Voice Interaction**
   - **Integration**: Use the **11 Labs API** to enable real-time voice input and output.
   - **Functionality**: Allow users to speak to AI agents and receive spoken responses seamlessly. Include visual indicators (e.g., a microphone icon that pulses when active, a waveform for speaking) to show when the AI is listening or responding.
   - **Implementation**: Embed a toggle button for voice mode within the conversational interface, ensuring intuitive usability.

2. **Agent Selection**
   - **Variety**: Provide a selection of **multiple AI agents**, each with a **unique personality and conversational style** (e.g., "Friendly Receptionist," "Professional Sales Agent," "Helpful Concierge").
   - **Display**: Present agents in an **interactive grid layout** using cards or tiles. Each card should include:
     - An **image or icon** representing the agent’s personality.
     - A **name** and **brief description** (e.g., "Emma: Warm and welcoming, perfect for customer service").
     - A **"Select" button** with hover effects (e.g., scale or color change).
   - **Implementation**: Use a responsive grid (`display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));`) to ensure adaptability across devices.

3. **Conversational Interface**
   - **Design**: Create an **intuitive chat-like interface** for user-AI interactions.
   - **Features**:
     - Display **conversation history** with clear distinctions between user inputs (e.g., right-aligned, light background) and AI responses (e.g., left-aligned, darker background).
     - Include a **text input field** alongside the voice toggle for dual interaction modes.
     - Use subtle animations (e.g., fade-in for new messages) to enhance engagement.
   - **Implementation**: Style with CSS to differentiate user and AI messages, and use JavaScript to update the history dynamically.

4. **Payment Processing**
   - **Integration**: Implement **Stripe** for secure payment processing.
   - **Functionality**: Enable potential monetization features, such as unlocking premium agents or extended interaction time. Include a checkout button or modal (e.g., "Upgrade to Premium" styled with rounded corners and a tech palette color).
   - **Implementation**: Use Stripe’s JavaScript SDK to handle transactions, ensuring a user-friendly and secure experience.

5. **SMS Notifications**
   - **Integration**: Use the **Twilio API** to send SMS messages.
   - **Functionality**: Send notifications or reminders related to AI interactions (e.g., "Your appointment with Agent Emma is confirmed for 3 PM"). Include an opt-in checkbox for user consent during interaction setup.
   - **Implementation**: Trigger SMS messages via Twilio based on user actions (e.g., scheduling or completing a conversation).

6. **Calendar Integration**
   - **Integration**: Incorporate the **Google Calendar API** for scheduling.
   - **Functionality**: Allow users to book appointments or schedule follow-ups with AI agents. Provide a calendar widget or button (e.g., "Schedule a Call") that connects to the user’s Google Calendar.
   - **Implementation**: Use OAuth for calendar access and display a confirmation modal after booking.

7. **Visual Design**
   - **Aesthetic**: Design a **visually striking and modern interface** that captivates potential clients with a tech-forward look.
   - **Key Elements**:
     - **Mountain PNG Logo**: Feature prominently in the header, footer, or as a fixed watermark with subtle animation (e.g., fade-in on load).
     - **Lenis Smooth Scrolling**: Implement using the Lenis library for a polished scrolling experience.
     - **Geometric Layouts**: Use a grid system (`display: grid`) for structured organization of content.
     - **Parallax Effects**: Apply to full-screen sections (e.g., hero image or agent selection) with `CSS position: fixed; transform: translateY();` and JavaScript for animation.
     - **Overlays**: Add semi-transparent dark overlays (`background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);`) on images and text for sophistication.
     - **Animated Components**: Include subtle hover effects (e.g., scale or shadow on agent cards) and dynamic transitions (e.g., slide-in for chat messages).
   - **Responsiveness**: Ensure all elements adapt seamlessly across devices using media queries.

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend
- **HTML**: Structure the site with semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- **CSS**:
  - Use `display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));` for layouts.
  - Apply `background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);` for overlays.
  - Implement Lenis smooth scrolling via CDN or npm package.
  - Add parallax effects with `position: fixed; transform: translateY();`.
  - Use media queries for responsiveness (e.g., adjust grid columns to `minmax(200px, 1fr)` on mobile).
- **JavaScript**:
  - Handle animations with CSS keyframes or a library like GSAP.
  - Manage dynamic updates (e.g., conversation history) with DOM manipulation.

#### Backend
- **Language**: Use **Node.js** (or Python) in Replit to handle API integrations.
- **APIs**:
  - **11 Labs**: Enable voice interaction with API calls for input/output.
  - **Stripe**: Process payments securely with server-side validation.
  - **Twilio**: Send SMS notifications with user-triggered events.
  - **Google Calendar**: Manage schedules with OAuth and API endpoints.
- **Setup**: Store API keys in Replit’s environment variables (e.g., `process.env.STRIPE_KEY`).

#### Database
- **Storage**: Use **MongoDB** (via MongoDB Atlas) or **Firebase** to store:
  - User interactions (e.g., conversation logs).
  - Agent data (e.g., names, personalities).
- **Implementation**: Connect via Replit’s database tools or external services.

#### Security
- **HTTPS**: Ensure secure data transmission (Replit provides this by default).
- **Best Practices**: Sanitize inputs, secure API keys, and handle payment data with Stripe’s protocols.
