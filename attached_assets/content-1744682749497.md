# Manage rate cardsPrivate preview

## Control billing cycles, customize pricing versions, and manage rate card subscriptions for usage-based billing.

Copy page

This guide describes how to update and maintain a [usage-based billing setup that uses rate cards](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards), including how to create distinct billing and service intervals, introduce new services to all subscribers, and set up pricing versions by user cohort.

## Set up a separate billing cadence and service interval ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

For example, you might want to provide customers with more frequent usage insights by assessing usage on a weekly basis (this is the service interval). However, to reduce administrative overhead, you only want to generate invoices monthly (this is the billing cadence).

Defining the service interval and billing cadence separately gives you the flexibility to aggregate usage and provision access at one frequency (for example, weekly) but bill customers at another (for example, monthly). This can help to optimize your cash flow needs.

Dashboard

API

When you create a rate card, you define a service interval that determines how often usage is aggregated (for example, weekly).

When you subscribe a customer to a rate card, you define a billing cadence that determines how often invoices are generated (for example, monthly-this doesn’t have to be the same frequency as the service interval).

## Roll out new services to all subscribers without code ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

If you launch a new feature with new pricing, you can roll out that pricing to all of your subscribers by adding a new rate to the rate card. All subscribers on the live version have access to the new service you added, and the new rate applies immediately.

When you add a new rate to your rate card, it’s immediately available to all subscribers on that version. Any usage reported against the new rate’s meter is priced according to this rate, even if you add it in the middle of a billing cycle. This lets you quickly launch new billable services (like a new AI model) without writing code.

To add new rates to your existing rate card through the Dashboard:

1. Go to the Rate cards page.
2. Select a rate card, then click **Edit rate card**.

## Set up different pricing versions by user cohort ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Rate cards use versioning to give you flexible pricing management. When you create a rate card, an initial live version is automatically set as the default for new subscribers. Adding new rates to a rate card doesn’t create a new version. Only modifying or deleting existing rates creates a new version. The original version remains live until you manually change the live version.

To offer different pricing to different customer cohorts:

1. Subscribe new customers to the current live version (default) of a rate card.
2. Create different versions for different customer segments.
3. Subscribe specific customers to older versions.

When you create a rate card subscription, you can specify which version to use:

Command Line

Select a languagecURL

```CodeBlock-code

curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v2/billing/rate_card_subscriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer

{{YOUR_API_KEY}}" \
  -H "Stripe-Version: 2025-03-31.preview" \
  --json '{
    "rate_card": "rcd_A",
    "billing_cadence": "bc_1",
    "rate_card_version": "rcdv_123"
  }'
```

If you don’t specify a version, Stripe automatically uses the current live version.

#### Changing rate card versions for current subscribers

To change the version for an existing subscriber, you must cancel their rate card subscription and create a new one with the new version.

## Roll out pricing changes in the middle of a billing cycle![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

You can migrate customers to a new rate card before the current billing cycle completes. To do this, [cancel the current subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards/manage#cancel) that use the old rate card. Then [subscribe your customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#subscribe) to the new rate card.

## Cancel rate card subscriptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

To cancel a rate card subscription:

- In the Dashboard, go to the Rate card subscriptions page and select the one you want to cancel. Click the overflow menu () to the right of the subscription and select **Cancel**.
- To use the API, make a request to the Cancel a rate card subscription endpoint:

Command Line

Select a languagecURL

```CodeBlock-code

curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v2/billing/rate_card_subscriptions/{{RATE_CARD_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}/cancel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer

{{YOUR_API_KEY}}" \
  -H "Stripe-Version: 2025-03-31.preview"
```
