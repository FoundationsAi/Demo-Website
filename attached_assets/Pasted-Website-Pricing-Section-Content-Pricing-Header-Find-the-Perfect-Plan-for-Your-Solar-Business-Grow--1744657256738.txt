Notes for Your Web Designer
1. Visual Design:
    * Use a clean pricing table with columns for each tier, highlighting Starter’s $49.99 price and free trials for Essential and Basic.
    * Add a “Most Popular” badge to the Basic tier to draw attention—it’s the sweet spot for growing businesses.
    * Include a prominent “Contact Us” button for Enterprise, with a form to capture leads.
2. Feature Breakdown:
    * List features under each tier clearly (e.g., minutes, concurrent calls, team access).
    * Emphasize “Unlimited AI Agents” as a headline feature across all tiers—make it bold or highlighted.
3. Call-to-Action:
    * Buttons should be vibrant and clickable (e.g., green for “Try Free,” blue for “Get Now”).
    * Add a secondary CTA below the table: “Not sure which plan? Chat with us!” linking to a contact form.
4. Additional Sections:
    * FAQ: Include questions like “What happens if I go over my minutes?” (Answer: Pay the overage fee listed for your plan.) and “How does testing work on Starter?” (Answer: Testing minutes count as half, so 1 minute of testing uses 0.5 minutes.)
    * Testimonial Placeholder: Reserve space for customer quotes (e.g., “Cut our lead gen time in half!”) to build trust.
5. Mobile Optimization: Ensure the pricing table is responsive, collapsing into a stacked view on mobile with expandable details for each tier.
