## Rate card subscription concepts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Here are the key concepts for understanding how rate card subscriptions work.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
|  |
| --- |
| Billing cadence | When invoices are generated and sent to your customers. The generated invoice consolidates charges that have accrued during one or more _service intervals_. You can configure different _billing cadences_ to match your business model. For example:<br>- **Monthly**: The customer receives a monthly invoice for all service usage in the previous month.<br>- **Quarterly**: Usage fees accrue monthly, but invoices are only generated once every three months.<br>- **Annual**: The customer is billed once a year for all services used during that year.<br>Billing cadences belong to customers: one cadence has one customer. (Each customer can have multiple cadences.) |
| Rate card | A collection of rates, representing a complete set of pricing plans for a product. You can subscribe customers to a rate card to create a _rate card subscription_ that’s associated with a billing _cadence_. You can subscribe multiple customers to a rate card. You can also subscribe customers to specific _rate card versions_. |
| Rate card subscription | The customer subscription associated with a rate card. You can associate multiple subscriptions with one billing _cadence_. This means that you can subscribe a customer to multiple rate cards with different _service intervals_ but the customer is only charged according to one cadence resulting in a single invoice. |
| Service interval | Defines the time period for measuring, calculating, and evaluating usage of your service against your pricing tiers. Service intervals also define when usage counters reset. Typically, service intervals align with your pricing structure. For example, a business offering AI services might have a _rate card rate_ with this pricing configuration: 1USD per workload for the first 10 workloads per month, then 2USD per workload. In this case, the service interval is one month, with usage counters resetting at the beginning of each month. |

## Billing cadence and service interval ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

The billing cadence defines when invoices are generated. The generated invoice consolidates charges that have accrued during one or more _service intervals_. You can configure different billing cadences to match your business model and pricing structures.

When a service interval ends, Stripe calculates charges based on usage during that period (for example, a customer’s usage for the past week). These charges are added to the customer’s account but aren’t necessarily billed immediately.

When a billing cycle ends, all accrued charges since the last billing cycle are compiled into an invoice and sent to the customer.

This separation allows for flexible billing arrangements, such as monthly service measurement with quarterly invoicing, or daily service measurement with weekly billing.

## Lifecycle![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Here’s what the lifecycle of a rate card subscription looks like:

1. You create the subscription and reference a rate card.
2. Usage is recorded and aggregated for each service interval.
3. An invoice is created for the subscription according to the billing cadence.
4. The customer’s payment method is charged.

## Collection status and servicing status ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Rate card subscriptions have two separate states:

- **Servicing state**: This is tied to the [service interval](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards/subscriptions#cadence-service-interval) and indicates when to provision or de-provision services. The servicing state of a rate card subscription can be one of:
  - Active
  - Paused
  - Canceled
- **Collection state**: This is tied to the [billing cadence](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards/subscriptions#cadence-service-interval) and defines the payment status of the rate card subscription. The collection state can be one of:
  - Current
  - Past due
  - Unpaid

Here’s how the statuses work together for subscriptions that charge a customer’s payment method automatically:

| Action | Servicing status | Collection status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subscription created | Active | Current |
| Payment successfully received | Active | Current |
| First payment attempt failed | Paused | Past due |
| All attempts to retrieve the payment failed | Paused | Unpaid |
| Associated invoice is marked as uncollectible | Paused | Unpaid |
| Payment received for all associated overdue invoices | Active | Current |
| User cancels subscription | Canceled | Remains in previous state |
| Dispute is opened | Paused | Unpaid |

Here’s how the statuses work together for subscriptions that send invoices:

| Action | Servicing status | Collection status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subscription created | Active | Current |
| Invoice generated but not paid (before payment due date) | Active | Current |
| Invoice hasn’t been paid (after payment due date) | Paused | Past due |
| Associated invoice is marked as uncollectible | Paused | Unpaid |
| Payment received for all associated overdue invoices | Active | Current |
| User cancels subscription | Canceled | Remains in previous state |

## How payments work with rate card subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

When you [create a rate card subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#subscribe), you define how to collect payments for the usage your customer accrues: charge the customer’s payment method automatically or send them an invoice at the end of each billing cycle.

You can collect payment details [when you create subscriptions for customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#subscribe).

An invoice is generated at the end of each billing cycle for each rate card subscription.

If you charge automatically, Stripe generates an invoice but doesn’t notify your customer about the invoice. If you’ve [enabled customer emails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails), Stripe sends an email receipt for successful payments.

If you send invoices, Stripe generates an invoice and sends it to your customer. which they can pay with the supported payment methods you’ve enabled.

### Invoice lifecycle for rate card subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

The basic lifecycle for invoices generated by rate card subscriptions looks like this:

1. The rate card subscription generates a new invoice in `draft` state.
2. The invoice finalizes immediately. You can’t make changes after the invoice is finalized.
3. The status is set to `open` and Stripe either automatically attempts to pay it using the customer’s default payment method or sends the customer an invoice.
4. If payment succeeds, the invoice status updates to `paid`.
5. If payment fails, the invoice remains `open` and the rate card subscription becomes `past_due`.

## Recovery settings for rate card subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

When payments fail for rate card subscriptions, Stripe’s default recovery behavior helps you recover revenue.

### Automated Retries![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

After creating a rate card subscription, payment failure is the most important event that can occur. Failures occur for many reasons:

- Lack of a payment method on the customer
- Expired payment method
- Declined payment

For rate card subscriptions, Stripe automatically retries failed payments based on your configured [subscription settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic). You can use either:

- [Smart Retries](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic), where machine learning picks the optimal retry time
- Scheduled retries, where you [configure the retry policy in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)

Use the [invoice.payment\_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.payment_failed) event to monitor subscription payment failure events and retry attempt updates. After a payment attempt on an invoice, its [next\_payment\_attempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt) value is set using the default retry settings.

If recovery fails after all retry attempts, the rate card subscription transitions to the _Unpaid_ collection state, and the servicing status is set to _Paused_ as shown in the [collection status and servicing status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards/subscriptions#collection-status-and-servicing-status) tables.

### Customer emails![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Stripe sends different emails to customers using the email addresses associated with the [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object:

- A [failed payment notification](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails#failed-payment-notifications) that prompts customers to update their payment information when a payment attempt fails.
- An expiring card notification when a customer’s default payment method card is due to expire.

You can customize the logos and colors your customers see in emails and the Hosted Invoice Payment page by changing the [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding) in the Dashboard.

## Rate card subscription events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

[Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/events) are triggered when subscriptions are activated or canceled. You can listen for events by using [event destinations](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations).

The following table describes the most common events related to rate card subscriptions. Use the event notifications to build your provisioning logic.

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
|  |
| --- |
| `v2.billing.rate_card_subscription.servicing_activated` | Sent when the [servicing status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards/subscriptions#collection-servicing-status) of a rate card subscription changes to active. |
| `v2.billing.rate_card_subscription.servicing_paused` | Sent when the [servicing status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards/subscriptions#collection-servicing-status) is paused. |
| `v2.billing.rate_card_subscription.servicing_canceled` | Sent when the [servicing status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards/subscriptions#collection-servicing-status) is canceled. |
| `v2.billing.rate_card_subscription.collection_current` | Sent when the [collection status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards/subscriptions#collection-servicing-status) changes to current. |
| `v2.billing.rate_card_subscription.collection_awaiting_customer_action` | Sent when payment collection requires customer action. |
| `v2.billing.rate_card_subscription.collection_paused` | Sent when the payment collection is paused. |
| `v2.billing.rate_card_subscription.collection_past_due` | Sent when [collection status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards/subscriptions#collection-servicing-status) changes to past due. |
| `v2.billing.rate_card_subscription.collection_unpaid` | Sent when the [collection status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards/subscriptions#collection-servicing-status) changes to unpaid. |

## Rate card subscriptions and tax collection![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

You can use [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax) to calculate the tax amount on recurring payments for rate card subscriptions. To automatically handle tax calculation when your customer is ready to pay, set the customer’s location details when you create a rate card subscription. Learn more about [collecting tax on usage-based rate card subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/subscriptions/rate-cards).
